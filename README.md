# Nostr

## Generating the Nostr Keys

Assuming you already have installed nodejs, lets install the package nostr-tools :

```npm install nostr-tools```

The code is the following:

```javascript
import {generatePrivateKey, getPublicKey} from 'nostr-tools'
let sk = generatePrivateKey() // `sk` is a hex string
let pk = getPublicKey(sk) // `pk` is a hex string
console.log("sk: "+sk)
console.log("pk: "+pk)
```

If you save the code as keys_gen.js, you can run the code as:

node keys_gen.js
something like this is going to show:

sk: 1b74b7d9fbc3404ebbc0889bd171ffb5ffd50820859f459c3cc69c640ae4b57d
pk: d44a780506d239b5b2f2107490e98ef50da11ca71af8ab69848b6d677bd3ead2

The first line is the secret key (SK) and the other one is the public key (PK).

## Fetching data from Nostr relays

Now that we have our keys, lets fetch data posted by a particular PK or user.

```javascript
const WebSocket = require('ws');
// connect to a relay
var ws = new WebSocket("wss://nostr-pub.wellorder.net");
// send a subscription request for text notes from authors with my pubkey
ws.addEventListener('open', function (event) {
 ws.send('["REQ", "my-sub", {"kinds":[1], "authors":["bac24cb2cc510b9ca611dd8ee2f94a1c51192fc25a4a7bf59293d8da77c73766"]}]');
});
// print out all the returned notes
ws.addEventListener('message', function (event) {
 if (JSON.parse(event.data)[2]!=null)
 console.log('Note: ', JSON.parse(event.data)[2]);
});
```

The PK here is bac24cb2cc510b9ca611dd8ee2f94a1c51192fc25a4a7bf59293d8da77c73766 and is a bot that send some trading signal everyday. 
If you save that code as check_posts.cjs you can run it as

node check_posts.cjs
That is the way you can read someones writings, just fetching the posts or notes publish by that PK on that relay.

Note the kinds array contains 1 which the kind of plain text note, similar to Twitter. There are others kinds, you can learn more [here](https://nostrdata.github.io/kinds/).


If we change the PK to your own recently generated PK (remember that you ran node keys_gen.js get that PK) on this example is d44a780506d239b5b2f2107490e98ef50da11ca71af8ab69848b6d677bd3ead2 and run again the check_posts.cjs script you will be waiting for new notes coming from that user, but so far should be none. Just donâ€™t close that terminal, because there we will be checking the new events send by the next code.

## Sending Notes to a Nostr Relay

Now that we are listening to our own notes, we can send a note to that same relay:

```javascript
const nt = require('nostr-tools');
const WebSocket = require('ws');
// connect to a relay
var ws = new WebSocket("wss://nostr-pub.wellorder.net");
let sk = '1b74b7d9fbc3404ebbc0889bd171ffb5ffd50820859f459c3cc69c640ae4b57d'
let pk = nt.getPublicKey(sk)
// send a subscription request for text notes from authors with my pubkey
ws.addEventListener('open', function (e) {
 
 let event = {
 kind: 1,
 pubkey: pk,
 created_at: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000),
 tags: [],
 content: "Have a nice day!"
 }
event.id = nt.getEventHash(event)
event.sig = nt.getSignature(event, sk)
console.log('["EVENT",'+JSON.stringify(event)+']')
ws.send('["EVENT",'+JSON.stringify(event)+']');
//Closing the websocket connection
ws.close();
 });
```
You have to change the SK hex string with your own SK generated before. Lets save that as send_note.cjs and run it as:

node send_note.cjs
Then we will see the output on the fetching console, running the code from the previous section. Great! That is a simple script.

The first 6 lines are setting up the keys and the connection to the relay wss://nostr-pub.wellorder.net then we add an listener to the web socket connection to be trigger when it opens. The function is the heart of the script and creates the event JSON ( let event ) the event id is created and also the signature and is included as part of the event:

```javascript
event.id = nt.getEventHash(event)
event.sig = nt.getSignature(event, sk)
```

Then the function proceeds to send ws.send and finally closes the connection with the relay ws.close(); .
